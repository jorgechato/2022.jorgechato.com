# Jorge Chato's articles

I'm moving all my architecture to serverless + static pages so from now on all
my articles will be hosted here and powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

The main theme will be [hution](https://github.com/jorgechato/hution) and it's inspired by Notion and Medium.
It's currently under development so it will be private for the time being.

## Run locally

```bash
$ hugo server -D --watch --verbose
```

## Install themes

```bash
$ git submodule add https://github.com/<username>/<repo>.git themes/<repo>
```
